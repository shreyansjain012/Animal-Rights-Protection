        <h3>Animals in the Wild</h3>
        <p>In 1985 WPA launched a campaign to outlaw bullfighting in cities in France and Spain.

            In the 1990s, the charity contributed to the prohibition of bear dancing in Greece, Turkey and India. In India, the charity funded a sanctuary for bears previously used in the trade.
            
            After a BBC investigation in September 2013, the charity launched a campaign against the caged civet coffee trade. Several retailers have since stopped selling coffee produced by caged civets.
            
            The charity campaigns in Asia for an end to the bear bile industry. In Pakistan they work to end bear baiting by campaigning for a change in law, offering alternative livelihoods to bear owners and housing bears rescued from bear baiting in a purpose built sanctuary.</p>

        <h3>Animals in Disasters</h3>
        <p>The charity has two disaster operations teams located in Asia and Latin America. In the aftermath of disasters they travel to worst affected areas to administer emergency veterinary care, distribute food and reunite animals with their owners where possible. The work is of particular benefit in developing world countries, where communities rely on animals for food, transport and income. The charity also works with governments and local animal welfare groups in disaster-prone areas to set up national warning systems and teach communities how to protect their animals in the event of a disaster.

            In November 2013 the charity were filmed for a BBC Documentary called Vets in the Disaster Zone, during disaster response work in the Philippines after Typhoon Haiyan. The programme aired on BBC Two on 28 April 2014.</p>

        <h3>Animals in the Communities</h3>
        <p>The organization is working to end the inhumane culling of stray dogs, which many countries do in a misguided effort to eliminate rabies. The organization points out that vaccination programs are the only effective way to eliminate rabies, and work with governments on vaccination programs. In 2012, a mass vaccination program was started in the Shaanxi, Guizhou and Anhui provinces of China, working with the Chinese Animal Disease Control Centre; as of June 2014, 750 veterinarians have been trained and over 90,000 dogs have been vaccinated. Mass vaccination programs have also been delivered in Bali, The Philippines, Bangladesh, Kenya, Zanzibar, and Kathmandu, Nepal.</p>

        <h3>Animals in the Farming</h3>
        <p>World Animal Protection works with governments, food businesses and farmers to improve the welfare of farmed animals. They encourage the general public to buy food produced in line with high welfare standards.

            In 2013 the charity joined with Compassion in World Farming to create a business benchmark on farm animal welfare (BBFAW). According to The Guardian, there has been a 10 percent rise in companies publishing farm animal welfare policies since the benchmark launched.</p>
